## About The Project

A tool to be used by advisors to create course plan for students.
When a new plan is created, a unique token is generated for that student. This token can be used to access the plan at a later time with a token that can be added to the path of the url.

When the plan is "saved" it will save in the database with under the token as a unique id. 

An administrator can view all entered tokens, their assigned advisors, and the created date of the plan on an admin page. 

Access to the admin page is with the login: 

*Username: admin*/
*Password: admin*
