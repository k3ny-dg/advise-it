## About The Project

A tool to be used by advisors to create course plan for students.
When a new plan is created, a unique token is generated for that student. This token can be used to access the plan at a later time. *Accessing plan with token is not working at this time*.

When the plan is "saved" it will save in the database with under the token as a unique id.
